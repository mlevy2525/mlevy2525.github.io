  * Summa Cum Laude and Tau Beta Pi
  * Minor in Mathematics
* Ph.D in Computer Vision and Robotics, University of Maryland - College Park, 2025 (expected)

Research experience
======
* University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies - Graduate Research Assistant
  * Advisor: Abhinav Shrivastava
  * Addressing robotic interaction with dynamic environments where changes in the environment are independent of the agent
  * Utilizing waypoint information to do imitation learning from a small numberof examples with limited information
