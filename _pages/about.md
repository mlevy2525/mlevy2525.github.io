I am a second year PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park. My advisor is Abhinav Shrivastava. You can read more about my work in the research tab.

In May 2019 I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Pennsylvania where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Mathematics.
